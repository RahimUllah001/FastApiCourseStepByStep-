Let me break this down step by step to explain how the process works and what happens at each stage.

1. Request Starts
What Happens:
When a client sends a request (e.g., a GET request to /sqlalchemy), FastAPI receives it and determines which route should handle it.

In this case, it identifies the function decorated with @app.get("/sqlalchemy").
FastAPI Prepares Dependencies:
FastAPI notices that the function test_posts has a dependency on db: Session = Depends(get_db).

FastAPI then calls the get_db function to create a database session (Session), which will be provided to the route.
2. Dependency Injection
What Happens:
Dependency injection is a mechanism FastAPI uses to "inject" the required resources (in this case, the db session) into a function automatically.

How It Works:

FastAPI calls the get_db function.
Inside get_db:
A new database session (SessionLocal) is created.
The session object is yielded, which means it is temporarily returned to the route handler (test_posts).
FastAPI passes this session object (db) as an argument to the route function.
Why Dependency Injection?

It makes your code cleaner and modular by separating resource creation (get_db) from business logic (test_posts).
It ensures the session is properly managed (i.e., automatically closed after the route finishes).
3. Perform Database Operations
What Happens: Inside the route (test_posts), you can now use the db session to interact with the database. For example:

python
Copy code
@app.get("/sqlalchemy")
def test_posts(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    posts = db.query(Post).all()  # Fetch all rows from the 'Post' table
    return {"posts": posts}
Details:

db.query(Post).all() queries all records from the Post table.
The db object tracks the operations you perform and manages them as part of a transaction.
You can perform other operations like adding, updating, or deleting records using the same session.
4. Request Ends
What Happens:

After the route function finishes (e.g., after returning the JSON response), FastAPI resumes execution of the get_db function.
The finally block inside get_db is triggered, ensuring the session is closed:
python
Copy code
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()  # Create a new session
    try:
        yield db  # Provide session to the route
    finally:
        db.close()  # Clean up the session
Why Close the Session?

The session holds database connections and other resources that must be released after the request is done.
If you don’t close it, you may run into connection leaks or resource exhaustion.
Flow Summary (Step-by-Step)
Here’s the full flow in a concise way:

Request Starts:

Client sends a request to the /sqlalchemy route.
FastAPI identifies the route and sees the dependency (db: Session = Depends(get_db)).
Dependency Injection:

FastAPI calls get_db to create a new database session (db).
This session is passed as an argument to the route function.
Perform Database Operations:

Inside the route, the db session is used to interact with the database (e.g., querying or saving data).
Request Ends:

After the route finishes, the session is automatically closed by FastAPI (via the finally block in get_db).
Why This Approach is Useful
Automatic Resource Management: FastAPI ensures sessions are created and closed properly for every request.

Cleaner Code: Dependency injection removes the need to manually manage database sessions in every route.

Scalability: Each request gets its own session, avoiding shared states between requests, which makes the application more scalable.
