<!-- project 7 crud operation on databse  using raw sql -->
as i have achieved crud operation through pythonic way but i have not mention how to create table through
so for this i  have 3 option 



The steps I outlined refer to accessing PostgreSQL through the terminal or command line interface, not pgAdmin. Here’s the clarification:

### Option 1: Using PostgreSQL in the Terminal/Command Line
This method involves interacting directly with PostgreSQL using its command-line tool (psql).

Steps to Use psql:
Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Use your operating system's terminal:

On Linux/Mac: Use the built-in terminal.
On Windows: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell (ensure PostgreSQL's bin directory is in your system's PATH).
Log into PostgreSQL: Run the following command to log in to the PostgreSQL server:

bash
Copy code
psql -U postgres
Replace postgres with your PostgreSQL username.
If prompted, enter the password.
Connect to Your Database: Once logged in, connect to the specific database (fastapi in this case):

sql
Copy code
\c fastapi;
This switches the session to the fastapi database.

Create the users Table: Run the SQL command:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Verify the Table Creation: After creating the table, list all tables in the database to confirm:

sql
Copy code
\dt
This displays all tables in the fastapi database, including users.

###  Option 2: Using pgAdmin
If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use pgAdmin, a web-based PostgreSQL management tool.

Steps for pgAdmin:
Open pgAdmin: Launch pgAdmin and log in with your PostgreSQL credentials.

Navigate to Your Database:

In the left-hand tree view, locate and expand your PostgreSQL server.
Expand the Databases node and select fastapi.
Open the Query Tool:

Right-click the fastapi database.
Select Query Tool.
Run the SQL Command: Paste the SQL code into the query editor:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Click the Execute/Run button to create the table.

Verify the Table:

Refresh the Schemas > public > Tables node under the fastapi database.
You should see the users table listed.
Which One Should You Use?
Use psql (Terminal): If you’re comfortable with command-line interfaces and want a lightweight solution.
Use pgAdmin: If you prefer a user-friendly, graphical environment for managing your database.
Both methods achieve the same result, so choose the one that suits your workflow best!

### Let's break down Option 2 for automating the creation of the users table directly in your FastAPI application. The goal is to use Python to execute the SQL code for creating the table when the app runs, either through a setup route or at app initialization.

Steps to Implement
1. Define the Table Creation Function
The function create_users_table() will execute the SQL command that creates the users table in PostgreSQL. This can be placed in the main file of your FastAPI app (where you define routes).

python
Copy code
import psycopg2
from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor

# Establish a database connection
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host='localhost',
    database='fastapi',
    user='postgres',
    password='Ali_wazir1',
    cursor_factory=RealDictCursor
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define a function to create the users table
def create_users_table():
    create_table_query = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    """
    # Execute the SQL command to create the table
    cursor.execute(create_table_query)
    conn.commit()  # Commit the transaction
    print("Users table created successfully")
Explanation:

The CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SQL statement ensures that the table is created only if it does not already exist, preventing errors on subsequent runs.
The cursor.execute() runs the SQL command, and conn.commit() saves the changes.
2. Call the Table Creation Function
You can call the create_users_table() function in two ways in FastAPI:

### **Option A: Call It at App Startup (Directly in Code)**
You can call this function when your app starts, ensuring the table is created as soon as the FastAPI server is run.

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# Call the function to create the table at startup
create_users_table()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Users table creation is automated"}
Explanation:

This ensures that the table is created as soon as the FastAPI application starts.
It is called directly in the code before any route is defined, guaranteeing that the table creation happens at startup.


### **Option B: Create a Setup Route (Call It via an HTTP Request)**
Alternatively, you can define a setup route that can be triggered via an HTTP request (e.g., /setup).

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/setup")
async def setup_database():
    create_users_table()  # Call the function to create the table
    return {"message": "Users table created successfully"}
Explanation:

When you navigate to http://localhost:8000/setup, the /setup route will execute the create_users_table() function and create the table if it doesn't already exist.
This is useful if you want to control when the table is created, for example, only running it once during the setup phase of your app.
3. Running the Application
After setting up either approach, you can run the FastAPI application:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
If using Option A, the table will be created automatically when the app starts.
If using Option B, navigate to http://localhost:8000/setup in your browser, and the users table will be created when you trigger the route.
Important Considerations
Database Connection: Make sure that your database credentials (host, user, password, etc.) are correct and that the database (fastapi in this case) exists.

Error Handling: In a production app, consider adding error handling, such as catching exceptions that could occur during table creation (e.g., connection errors).

Table Creation Once: You can use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS to ensure the table is created only once, which is helpful during development but should be avoided for schema migrations in production.

Summary
Option A: Call the create_users_table() function directly at app startup (good for simple setups).
Option B: Create a /setup route that creates the table when accessed (more flexible for development or one-time setup).
This gives you flexibility depending on how you want to manage the creation of the users table in your FastAPI app.
