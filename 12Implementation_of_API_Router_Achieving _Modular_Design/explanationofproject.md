"API Structure with FastAPI Routers"
Explanation for the Project:
This project showcases how to organize a FastAPI application by separating API routes into modular components using APIRouter. Instead of defining all routes in the main.py file, the application uses:

Routers for Logical Separation:

This project showcases how to organize a FastAPI application by separating API routes into modular components using APIRouter. Instead of defining all routes in the main.py file, the application uses:

Routers for Logical Separation:

post.py: Handles all operations related to posts.
user.py: Manages user-related operations.
Main File for App Initialization:

main.py: Acts as the central point to include routers (post.router and user.router) and define app-wide settings or middleware.
Benefits of Modular Routing:

Keeps the codebase clean and manageable as the application grows.
Allows logical grouping of routes by functionality.
Simplifies testing, debugging, and future feature additions.
This architecture is essential for building scalable, maintainable FastAPI applications..py: Handles all operations related to posts.
