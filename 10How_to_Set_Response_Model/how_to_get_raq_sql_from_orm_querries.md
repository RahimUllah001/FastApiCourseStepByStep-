To see the SQL query generated by SQLAlchemy for a query like db.query(models.Post).all(), you can use SQLAlchemy's built-in logging and debugging tools. Here are a few methods:

Method 1: Use str() on the Query Object
You can convert the query to a string before executing it. However, this only works for queries that are not executed yet (like .all() or .first()).

python
Copy code
query = db.query(models.Post)
print(str(query))
This will output the raw SQL query. Note: This won't include the values bound to parameters (e.g., WHERE id = :id will show :id instead of the actual value).

Method 2: Enable SQLAlchemy Logging
If you want to see all the queries executed by SQLAlchemy during your application's runtime, enable its built-in logging.

Add the following at the start of your application:
python
Copy code
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger("sqlalchemy.engine").setLevel(logging.INFO)
Run your application, and you will see the executed SQL queries printed to the console.
Method 3: Use SQLAlchemy's statement Attribute
For more advanced queries (with filters or joins), you can use the statement attribute to inspect the query.

python
Copy code
query = db.query(models.Post)
print(query.statement)
This will return the SQL statement in a human-readable form.

Method 4: Enable Echo Mode in the Engine
When creating the engine, set echo=True. This logs all SQL statements executed by SQLAlchemy.

python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
Now, whenever a query is executed, SQLAlchemy will automatically print the generated SQL statement to the console.

Example Output
For a query like db.query(models.Post).all(), you might see:

sql
Copy code
SELECT posts.id, posts.title, posts.content 
FROM posts
This helps you debug and understand exactly what SQL statements are being executed behind the scenes.
